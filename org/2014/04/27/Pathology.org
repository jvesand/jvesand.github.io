****** Infarction
:PROPERTIES:
:tangle:   no
:END:

There are two regions of an infarct. The *core* receives blood only from the occluded artery and so at risk for *lasting damage*, while the *penumbra* (borders the core) is perfused by other arteries and has a greater chance of *surviving the infarction* due to collateral blood flow.

This is python:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
print "testing to see if this works"
#+END_SRC

This is elisp:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun lawlist-toggle-block-visibility ()
"For this function to work, the cursor must be on the same line as the regexp."
(interactive)
(if
    (save-excursion
      (beginning-of-line 1)
      (looking-at ;; for individual footnotes, remove .* and put manual func
       ".*\\[fn::\\|^\\#\\+BEGIN_HTML.*$\\|^[ \t]*:PROPERTIES:[ \t]*$"))
    (lawlist-org-flag (not (get-char-property (match-end 0) 'invisible)))
  (message "Sorry, you are not on a line containing the beginning regexp.")))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_HTML
<button onclick="alert('you are!');">I feel lucky!</button>
#+END_HTML

Occlusion of multiple arteries or decrease in cerebral perfusion results in *watershed infarcts*. *Watershed areas* are areas at greatest risk of permanent injury are those at the border between major cerebral arteries.

Infarcted brain tissue is cleared by macrophages and undergoes *liquefactive necrosis*.

The severity of an infarction is determined by the presence of *collateral flow*.

****** Vascular Malformations
******* Aneurysm
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       C49B339D-012C-4CFB-9A79-A041982263FC
:END:

An aneurysm is an out-pouching of a blood vessel wall. Risk factors include smoking, hypertension, polycystic kidney disease, coarctation of the aorta, and connective tissue disorders (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome).

Aneurysms most commonly occur at the *anterior communicating artery* (~40%) and the branch point of the *middle cerebral artery* (~40%). Rupture of an aneurysm results in [[id:B1B6E99D-B600-4421-A8BC-B1FDD8F9C191][subarachnoid hemorrhage]]. Surgery or endovascular embolization is performed to occlude the aneurysm because early re-hemorrhage is likely fatal.

******* Cavernous Malformation

A cavernous malformation is a *compact ball of vessels* without any recognizable intervening neural parenchyma. Can result in seizure disorder or rarely hemorrhage.

Diagnose with MRI - *popcorn* appearance.

******* Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)

An arteriovenous malformation is a direct connection of artery and vein without capillary bed. In *hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia*, multiple AVMs are seen.

Can be treated with surgery, focused radiation, or endovascular occlusion.
